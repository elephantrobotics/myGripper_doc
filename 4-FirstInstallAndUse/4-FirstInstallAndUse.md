## 3 Notes
** The following rules should be followed when using the three-finger dexterous hand:**
* Please distinguish the line sequence according to the line mark. If the line mark is lost, detached, or forgotten, please contact our staff to cooperate in determining the line sequence. If you do not contact our staff, <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">you will be responsible for the consequences if the smart hand is damaged due to the wrong wiring sequence</span>
* Please do not burn other product drivers without authorization, or use unofficial recommended methods to burn firmware. <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">If the device is damaged due to the user's personal burning of other firmware, it will not be covered by after-sales service. </span>
* <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">If the surface of the smart hand is stained by use, it is recommended to wipe it gently with clean water. To avoid coating damage, do not use alcohol solvents to clean the shell and finger sleeves. </span>If the surface is damaged due to the use of alcohol cleaners and needs to be repaired or replaced, our company will charge the corresponding repair fee according to the terms of the contract
